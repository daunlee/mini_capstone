"""
In order to use any of the search methods in lab2_algorithms.py
you'll need define some utility functions and heuristic evaluation functions.

A few have been provided for you, and you can create as many additional ones as
you like (add to the game specific dict to show them on the GUI)

You MUST implement the following:
Part 1:
    basic_endgame_utility
    faster_endgame_utility
    win_paths_eval_tictactoe
Part 2:
    weighted_chains_eval_connectfour
Part 3:
    aggressive_eval_roomba
    defensive_eval_roomba

You MAY wish to implement the following to stretch your creativity:
    advanced_heuristic_eval_connectfour
    advanced_heuristic_eval_roomba

Some useful built-in python methods:
    any(list-like) - returns if at least one True
    all(list-like) - returns if all are True
    sum(list-like) - returns sum of all (??)
    listobj.count(item) - returns count of items in list
